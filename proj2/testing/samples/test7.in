# A simple test of adding, committing, modifying, and checking out.
#Any files that are tracked in the current branch
#but are not present in the checked-out branch are deleted" from the checkout spec,
# so maybe try adding, committing, removing, make a new branch, switch branches,
#then create the file again and switch branches back to the initial one
#Create two branches that track different files and switch between them.
# Make sure files are added, modified, and removed correctly.
